# monospace

This is my technical assignment as part of my interview process for Monospace. I was tasked with creating a React app that fetches data from a REST endpoint,
stores them into the Redux store and displays them on a table, which I was tasked to recreate given a specific design. The table also featured entry updates that had to
be sent via new requests.

## technologies used

* React 16.13.1, fully functional approach with hooks
* React-Redux
* Material-UI
* axios
